In React Native, a seemingly innocuous issue can arise when using `FlatList` or `SectionList` with complex data structures or numerous components.  The root cause often lies in inefficient rendering or excessive re-renders triggered by seemingly unrelated data changes. For example, suppose you have a `FlatList` displaying a list of items, each with its own nested components that trigger re-renders on even small data updates.
